Title, description, due-date, priority / notes, checklist

projects | todos

some sort of ‘default’ project

separate modules i.e. creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing todo priority etc.) | DOM-related stuff

<ui>
• view all projects
• view all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate.. perhaps changing color for different priorities)
• expand a single todo to see/edit it’s details
• User can edit the details of a to-do item
• delete a todo

Use localStorage to save user’s projects and todos between sessions.
